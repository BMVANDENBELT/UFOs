# UFOs

# OVERVIEW
- We used JavaScript to add multiple filters to a UFO-Sighting webpage so we could search for multiple criteria at the same time. From there, we learned how to change filters and adjust tables from those first changes. It's important to note that we are able to interact with more data when we add additional filters. We used Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to accomplish this task.

# RESULTS
- When we created the webpage, it turned out looking like what you see below.

- At a quick glance, you can see that there are filters we have added to facilitate accurate parameters of their "end-goal search". To show how it works, I decided to filter for state, "ca" (California). The search results were posted below.

- Following that, we have the option to filter by shape (circle) and the results for all "circle shaped UFOs" were presented before me as well.

- The cool thing about this is we can filter for multiple parameters at the same time. If we wanted to see results for Triangular shaped UFOs in CA, we just filter by state and shape. We can also search by city! The only thing is that, the more parameters you add, the more the table will shrink.

# SUMMARY
- From testing the filters, I found that one of the biggest drawbacks for our filters was that it is case-sensitive. When I first searched the city of "Bonita", nothing came up. When I dropped the "B" to a lowercase "b", the results for that city showed up in the data-set below. (See below)

One reccommendation I would make for this in the future is that it would be super helpful to have
